# CHANGELOG

We use this CHANGELOG to document breaking changes, new features, bug fixes, and config value changes that may affect both the usage of the workflows and the outputs of the workflows.

## 2025

* TBD: [breaking] Switch to use `augur subsample` @victorlin
    * A new `subsample` configuration section replaces the previous `subsampling` section. The new syntax defines samples in native YAML rather than a long string of `augur filter` arguments.
* TBD: Configuration resolved at run time is now written to a file `results/{build}/run_config.yaml`. @victorlin
* 24 March 2025: Add frequencies panel @j23414
* 21 March 2025: Migrated WA specific config to NW-PaGe [PR#90] @j23414, @DOH-LMT2303, @DOH-PNT0303
* 18 March 2025: Rename "global" to "all-lineages, update various auspice_config settings @j23414
* 14 March 2025: Pushed from staging to live @j23414
* 11 March 2025: Added lineage-1A and lineage-2 phylogenetic trees [PR#61](https://github.com/nextstrain/WNV/pull/61) @j23414
* 5 March 2025: Adopt NW-PaGe README template to document Nextstrain analysis and scientific decisions [PR#76](https://github.com/nextstrain/WNV/pull/76) @DOH-LMT2303
* 23 February 2025: Adopt Avian-flu style merging of additional data during the phylogenetic workflow [PR#68](https://github.com/nextstrain/WNV/pull/68) @j23414
    * From a brief discussion with James Hadfield, the generic API pattern of merging additional data is solidified while the implementation details are still being hashed out in Zika and avian flu pipelines. @j23414 figured that we can update to the final settled decision later especially since the generic API pattern is easier to explain in documentation to other state labs.

* 13 January 2025: Switch to full_authors and authors fields to align with the pathogen repo guide [PR#56](https://github.com/nextstrain/WNV/pull/56) @DOH-LMT2303

## pre-2024

* The WNV workflows associated with the Hadfield paper was originally maintained at https://github.com/nextstrain/WNV, but was later renamed and archived at https://github.com/nextstrain/WNV-old .
* To update the pipeline and establish a collaboration between Nextstrain and WA-DOH, the WNV repository was initialy forked to https://github.com/NW-PaGe/WNV.
* Later on, to avoid duplicating work, the WNV repository was then mirrored back to https://github.com/nextstrain/WNV, and WA-DOH collaborators were added so they could contribute to the codebase directly.
